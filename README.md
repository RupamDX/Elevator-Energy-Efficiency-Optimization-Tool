Elevator Energy Efficiency Optimization Tool

An intelligent tool designed to forecast elevator energy consumption, calculate savings, and promote sustainability by optimizing elevator operations. This solution leverages Prophet time-series forecasting and AI-powered summaries to provide actionable insights.

Problem Statement
Elevators are one of the most energy-intensive systems in buildings. They often operate at full capacity during off-peak hours, leading to unnecessary energy consumption, increased operational costs, and a higher carbon footprint.

This tool addresses the following challenges:
Unnecessary energy consumption during low-demand periods.
High energy costs for building operators.
Environmental impact due to excess carbon emissions.

Solution Overview

The Elevator Energy Efficiency Optimization Tool uses historical elevator data to:
Predict future energy consumption trends.
Identify low-demand periods where standby mode can save energy.
Calculate potential cost and environmental savings.
Provide stakeholders with clear, actionable summaries.

Key Features
Historical Data Analysis: Visualize and analyze elevator energy usage and patterns.
Time-Series Forecasting: Use the Prophet model to predict future energy consumption.
Savings Calculator: Quantify energy and cost savings with a configurable baseline threshold.
